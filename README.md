## 🧰 Powered By

This project leverages cutting-edge AI tools and hackathon sponsor technologies:

| Tool | How We Used It |
|------|----------------|
| **🎵 ElevenLabs** | AI-generated background music — each game world has its own unique soundtrack, and every new PDF upload generates fresh music |
| **🧠 OpenAI GPT-4** | Powers the entire question generation pipeline — extracting insights from content and creating contextual quiz questions |
| **🎨 Google Gemini** | Asset generation for game visuals and sprites |
| **🎯 v0** | Rapid UI prototyping for the pixel-art interface |
| **🤝 Miro** | Team collaboration, user flow mapping, and ideation |
| **⚡ Cursor** | Vibe coding with AI — built the entire codebase with agentic AI assistance |

## 🎯 The Problem

We fail to transfer information into long-term memory. Studies show **passive watching and reading leads to 90% memory loss within 7 days**. Despite consuming hours of educational content, we retain almost nothing.

Traditional learning is broken because:
- **Passive consumption** doesn't create lasting neural pathways
- **No active recall** means no memory consolidation
- **No engagement** leads to distraction and boredom

## 💡 The Solution

**Anything → RPG** is a playable memory palace that transforms passive knowledge into interactive RPG quests.

Upload any PDF — a book, course notes, research paper — and our AI automatically:
1. **Splits it into chapters** using intelligent parsing
2. **Extracts key insights** from each section
3. **Generates quiz questions** at varying difficulty levels
4. **Creates an RPG world** where you battle NPCs by answering questions

**Why it works:**
- 🧠 **Active Recall**: Answering questions boosts retention by 50% vs. passive reading
- 🎮 **Gamification**: Game mechanics (XP, levels, progress) trigger dopamine and motivation
- 🔁 **Spaced Repetition**: Multiple levels reinforce learning over time
- ⚔️ **Learn by Doing**: Interactive quizzes create stronger memory traces

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube2rpg.git
   cd youtube2rpg
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**

   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create `.env` in the root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

   Create `frontend/.env`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

5. **Run the development servers**
   
   Backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧪 How Question Generation Works

1. **PDF Upload** → Content extracted via `unpdf`
2. **Chapter Detection** → AI identifies logical sections
3. **Insight Extraction** → Key facts and concepts identified
4. **Question Generation** → 3 questions per chapter at varying difficulty
5. **Game Creation** → Questions mapped to NPCs across levels

Each chapter becomes an NPC battle, with 4 NPCs per level creating a structured learning journey.
