  "key_takeaways": [
    "Foreknowledge enables victory and cannot be obtained from spirits or deduction alone - it comes from human intelligence.",
    "Five classes of spies exist: local, inward, converted, doomed, and surviving.",
    "The converted spy - turning enemy agents to your side - is the key to all intelligence operations."
