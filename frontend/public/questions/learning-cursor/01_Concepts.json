  "key_takeaways": [
    "Tab provides code completion that predicts multi-line edits based on your current code and recent changes.",
    "Agent is an AI that can read and modify code across multiple files autonomously.",
    "Inline Edit lets you edit selected code with natural language using Cmd+K.",
    "Rules define custom instructions for AI behavior including coding standards and project conventions."

      "question": "What is the key difference between Semantic Search and regular text search in Cursor?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Semantic Search only works with Python files", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Semantic Search finds code by meaning, not just exact text matches", "correct": true },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Semantic Search is slower but more accurate for syntax errors", "correct": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Semantic Search only works in the terminal", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Semantic Search finds code by understanding its meaning, enabling natural language code search and context-aware suggestions rather than just matching text patterns."
