  "key_takeaways": [
    "Agent is built on instructions (system prompt and rules), tools (file editing, search, terminal), and user messages.",
    "There is no limit on the number of tool calls Agent can make during a task.",
    "Checkpoints are automatic snapshots of Agent's changes, letting you undo modifications if needed.",
    "You can queue follow-up messages while Agent is working on the current task."
