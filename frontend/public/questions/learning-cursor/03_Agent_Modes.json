  "summary": "Agent offers different modes optimized for specific tasks: Agent mode for complex features, Ask mode for learning and questions, Plan mode for detailed planning, and Debug mode for troubleshooting.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Agent mode has all tools enabled for complex features and refactoring.",
    "Ask mode is read-only for learning and exploring code without making changes.",
    "Plan mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing code.",
    "Debug mode uses hypothesis generation, log instrumentation, and runtime analysis for tricky bugs."

      "question": "When debugging with Debug Mode, what is the recommended approach if you're stuck after reproducing the bug?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Immediately make code changes based on your gut feeling", "correct": false },

      ],
      "explanation": "Reproducing the bug multiple times may help the agent identify particularly tricky problems like race conditions. Debug Mode uses runtime evidence rather than guessing at fixes."
