  "summary": "AI can behave unexpectedly due to prompt injection, hallucinations, and other issues. Cursor protects users with guardrails that limit what agents can do, with sensitive actions requiring manual approval by default.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Reading files and searching code don't require approval, but use .cursorignore to block access to specific files.",
    "Terminal commands need approval by default - review every command before letting the agent run it.",
    "All MCP connections need approval, and each tool call still needs individual approval.",
    "Agents can modify workspace files without approval except for configuration files."

      "question": "What file should you create to block Agent access to specific files in your project?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": ".gitignore", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": ".cursorignore", "correct": true },

        { "id": "d", "text": "cursor.config", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Use .cursorignore to block agent access to specific files. Reading files and searching code don't require approval, so this file is important for protecting sensitive content."

      "question": "Why should you never use 'Run Everything' mode in Cursor Agent?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "It's slower than other modes", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "It costs more money", "correct": false },
        { "id": "c", "text": "It skips all safety checks, allowing potentially dangerous actions", "correct": true },
        { "id": "d", "text": "It only works with specific programming languages", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "'Run Everything' mode skips all safety checks. The allowlist feature is best-effort and bypasses are possible. Terminal commands can be dangerous and should always be reviewed."

      "question": "What security risk exists when using auto-reload with Agent changes?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Files might get corrupted", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Agent changes might execute before you can review them", "correct": true },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Network requests might fail", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "If you have auto-reload enabled, agent changes might execute before you can review them. Always use version control so you can revert changes, and be cautious with auto-reload settings."
