  "summary": "Rules provide system-level instructions to Agent. They bundle prompts, scripts, and more together, making it easy to manage and share workflows. Cursor supports Project Rules, User Rules, Team Rules, and AGENTS.md.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Project Rules are stored in .cursor/rules as markdown files and are version-controlled.",
    "Rule types include Always Apply, Apply Intelligently, Apply to Specific Files (globs), and Apply Manually.",
    "Keep rules under 500 lines and reference files instead of copying contents.",
    "AGENTS.md is a simple markdown alternative to .cursor/rules for straightforward use cases."
