  "summary": "Tab is a specialized Cursor model for autocompletion. It can modify multiple lines at once, add import statements, jump within and across files, and learns from your acceptance patterns.",
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Accept suggestions with Tab, reject with Escape, or accept word-by-word with Cmd+Arrow Right.",
    "Tab predicts your next editing location and can jump across files.",
    "Auto-import automatically adds import statements in TypeScript and Python.",
    "Tab works in Go to Definition peek views for modifying function signatures."

      "question": "How does Tab display suggestions for modifying existing code versus adding new code?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Both appear as inline text", "correct": false },

      "explanation": "When adding text, completions appear as semi-opaque ghost text inline. When modifying existing code, Tab shows a diff popup to the right of your current line."
