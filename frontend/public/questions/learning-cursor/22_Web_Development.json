    "Integrate Linear with its MCP server for project management context.",
    "Use Figma's MCP server to access designs directly in Cursor.",
    "Create rules for your design system to help Agent reuse existing components.",
    "Use Cursor Browser for testing and visual debugging."

      "question": "When should you switch from Chat to Inline Edit and Tab in web development?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Never - always use Chat", "correct": false },

      "explanation": "Chat is great for bootstrapping changes. Once the major pieces are in place, switching to Inline Edit and Tab helps maintain your flow state for smaller, iterative changes."
