    "Use Chat to ask questions and navigate unfamiliar code quickly.",
    "Write rules to capture latent knowledge not in documentation.",
    "Spend extra time creating precise, well-scoped plans for larger changes.",
    "Pick the right tool: Tab for quick edits, Inline Edit for focused changes, Chat for multi-file work."
