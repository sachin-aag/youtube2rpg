  "summary": "This episode explores the biology, psychology, and utility of play throughout life. It emphasizes how engaging in low-stakes, contingency-testing activities can enhance neuroplasticity and expand the prefrontal cortex's capacity for prediction and adaptation. Ultimately, incorporating play into adulthood fosters creativity, emotional well-being, and social intelligence.",
