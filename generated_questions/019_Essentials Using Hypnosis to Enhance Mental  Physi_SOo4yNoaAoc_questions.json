  "summary": "This podcast episode explores the science and practical applications of hypnosis. It defines hypnosis as a state of highly focused attention, similar to looking through a telephoto lens, and distinguishes clinical hypnosis from stage hypnosis. The discussion covers the neural mechanisms underlying hypnosis, including changes in brain activity and connectivity, and its therapeutic uses for stress reduction, sleep improvement, pain management, and trauma processing. The episode also touches on hypnotizability, the role of breathing, and the potential for self-hypnosis and clinical hypnosis to enhance mental and physical health.",
