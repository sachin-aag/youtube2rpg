  "summary": "Many FDA-approved drugs have diverse mechanisms of action beyond their primary intended use. Repurposing existing drugs can provide effective treatments for diseases, even when no dedicated treatments exist.  Exploring the full potential of available medications requires a systematic approach, including analysis of existing data and clinical trials. Advocating for novel uses of drugs can significantly improve patient outcomes, particularly for rare and complex conditions.",
