  "summary": "This podcast episode explores the science of human mate selection, covering both short-term and long-term relationship dynamics from an evolutionary psychology perspective. It examines the criteria men and women prioritize when choosing partners, the role of deception, and the influence of factors like physical attractiveness, resource acquisition, and the 'dark triad' personality traits. The conversation also delves into jealousy, stalking, and the impact of early childhood attachment on adult relationships, providing a comprehensive overview of the complex factors shaping human mating behaviors.",
